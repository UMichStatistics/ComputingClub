      <description>With the recent creation of the Statistics Computing Club, having a platform to share news, contents and resources was a priority.
The site is functionnal but still under construction, so please report issues to the GitHub repository to help us improve the site. Also, your comments and suggestions are more than welcome, so feel free to contact us!
The Committee is still looking for presenters for this fall&amp;rsquo;s meetings. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be an expert of the topic you&amp;rsquo;ll present; providing exposure to a tool you find useful, to a package you think may help others or to some research methodology may be relevant to many other members!</description>
