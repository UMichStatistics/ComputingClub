We will cover\n how to create a website, two ways to host your website for everyone to see!   Today\u0026rsquo;s talk is sad in the following sense:\n You won\u0026rsquo;t learn anything that will make you a better statistician or researcher It is still relevant professionally.    Why have a personal academic website Having a personal website serves multiple goals:\n Professional goals  Host a public resume List your publications, research interests, experience, etc. Allows people to find you and contact you Have an easy way to point to you \u0026ldquo;Online presence\u0026rdquo;  Exposure for your work \u0026amp; research  Build workshops, courses and tutorials for everyone to access Present your research in alternative ways (other than articles, talks, posters, etc.)  Host content for courses  e.g. Canvas may have some limitations that a website might not have Make your teaching content public     Have a website before you need one:\n It is a tidy place to keep track of your publications, talks, accomplishments, etc. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend time building a website when you\u0026rsquo;re looking for internships/jobs/grants/contributors/etc.  It is also a humbling experience:\n The first time you set up your own website, you will most likely have very few things to put on it; Additional motivation and incentive to building your image and career.    Other uses for simple website\n Research group page Student organization Documenting a software or package you developed Online book Artist portfolio Blogging   A quick primer on (static) websites Most websites you encounter consist of html (HyperText Markup Language) code and embed other languages to allow more interaction (javascript, Perl, etc.). A website contains multiples pages, often arranged into different subdirectories, just like regular file management. In particular, you can see a website as a tree where the accessible leaves are the .html pages.\nEach page you access is a generally a .html file, but in general no one actually write html directly\u0026mdash;developers use programming languages that generate the html for themselves. The style of a page\u0026mdash;colors, font, placement, etc.\u0026mdash;are generally contained in css (Cascading Style Sheets) files. One goal of this workshop is to build a website without ever writing html or css.\nindex.html has a special status within a directory. Accessing site/subdir/ automatically loads site/subdir/index.html.\nAbout Hugo Hugo is a framework for developing websites. In particular, it generates the desired html pages given some developer input in Markdown files. The engine uses the Go language to interpret the Markdown and produce the corresponding html files.\nIn addition to Markdown files, the developer also modify configuration files and Markdown front matters, in simple toml format, to determine meta-information about the website and control visual aspects. Both Markdown and toml languages have simple and intuitive syntax so the learning curve is very steep. Once the base website is set up, editing and adding content is only a matter of creating folder, creating and editing Markdown files and editing toml files.\n I will be using Hugo throughout the tutorial, but only to create the website.\nHosting the website is completely independent of Hugo.\n  Markdown file front matters An important concept to understand about Markdown files is the file layout. Each .md file must contain a front matter part which describe some meta information about the content of the file; the front matter is then followed by the content itself in the body of the file. In the present context, the front matters will contain, among other things,\n a high-level description of the page, the type of page to specify to the Hugo compiler, some details about indexing and referencing across pages.  Example:\n--- # Front matter title: \u0026quot;MyFirstPost\u0026quot; subtitle: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; summary: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; authors: [] tags: [] categories: [] date: 2019-10-04T18:18:52-04:00 lastmod: 2019-10-04T18:18:52-04:00 featured: false draft: false --- \u0026lt;!-- Body of the file --\u0026gt; The content of the post goes here ...  The Academic theme for Hugo The way to use Hugo is to start from a template (or theme) and adapt it to your personal needs. Different themes implement different type of contents and are therefore suited for different purpose.\nIn this tutorial we will consider the Academic theme which is one of the more complete theme and is particularly well-suited for an academic website (as the name suggests!) Here are some of the things Academic allows:\n Blog posts Documentation Publications Talks Projects Multiple authors General pages Home page with widgets structure  More Hugo themes  Resume-type themes  Resume theme is another slick theme I found.  Documentation-type themes (many equivalent options) Portofolio-type themes (many equivalent options) Blog-type themes (many equivalent options)  Alternatives to Hugo  HTML from scratch  Highly not recommended  Jekyll  Very similar to Hugo (all content is Markdown, similar shell commands) Slightly more complicated, but has slightly more features I have not found a theme that matches the capabilities of Academic for Hugo (see e.g. Jekyll Academic and its demo site) GitHub Pages built-in themes (using Jekyll) can be up in a few clicks  WYSIWYG editor  WordPress Google Sites WiX and many others  More advanced alternatives  Grav Drupal    Alternative hosting  Netlify WordPress and WiX offers free hosting options Any other web host ($, e.g. AWS)  Main takeaways  Creating your own website is easy and you should definitely do it soon. People have made it easy for you to display your work; make use of all the tools available! Creating the content for your website, not building and deploying it, should consist most of the work you have to do.

Hugo acts as an interpreter and compiler: it translates the file structure, the Markdown files and some configuration files (yaml or toml) into the html files visible to the visitor.\nRepository description The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. The static contents of the website appears in the docs folder of the UmichStatistics GitHub organization repository ComputingClub. The other folders and files of the repository are used to generate the website: only the docs folder is necessary for the static website to be operational.\nDeployment Any change in the files outside of the docs folder will not affect the public website. In order for the changes to become public, it is necessary to deploy the website, i.e. to use Hugo to update the files in docs. Hence, anyone updating the website needs to run Hugo for the changes to appear.

Why use functional programming?

Mapping  map is pretty much equivalent to lapply, but has some additional features\nlibrary(purrr) my_sqrt \u0026lt;- function(x) sqrt(x) str(map(c(1,2,3,4,5), my_sqrt))  ## List of 5 ## $ : num 1 ## $ : num 1.41 ## $ : num 1.73 ## $ : num 2 ## $ : num 2.24  str(lapply(c(1,2,3,4,5), my_sqrt))  ## List of 5 ## $ : num 1 ## $ : num 1.41 ## $ : num 1.73 ## $ : num 2 ## $ : num 2.24   Mapping  If we want an atomic double vector instead of a list, the map_dbl ensures we always receive that. sapply does the same thing in this particular instance, but we can run into problems\u0026hellip;\nstr(map_dbl(c(1,2,3,4,5), my_sqrt))  ## num [1:5] 1 1.41 1.73 2 2.24  str(sapply(c(1,2,3,4,5), my_sqrt))  ## num [1:5] 1 1.41 1.73 2 2.24   Problem: sapply is not type-safe!

This is a great way to propogate errors. We have no way to guarentee whether sapply will return a \u0026ldquo;double\u0026rdquo; vector or a \u0026ldquo;string\u0026rdquo; vector.  map_dbl is type-safe! str(map_dbl(c(1,2,3,4,5), my_sqrt))  ## num [1:5] 1 1.41 1.73 2 2.24  try(str(map_dbl(c(-1,2,-3,4,5), my_sqrt)))  ## Error : Can't coerce element 1 from a character to a double   The map_* family of functions allows us to explictly impose which type we expect the output vector to be.

No errors now because both doubles and characters can be coerced to double.  map_* is type-safe!  sapply implicitly coerces to an atomic vector in the most general unit in the output for \u0026ldquo;convenience\u0026rdquo;, but this is very prone to unexpected errors. Most of the time, it is better to be explicit to catch any errors early and keep type stability. Can also use _lgl for logical, _int for integer, _raw for raw type, _dfr and _dfc for data-table columns and rows.

Most of the following is a summary or reinterpretation of the Academic theme documentation.\nFor more details about Hugo itself, see Hugo Getting Started\nPrerequsites In order to perform the following manipulations, you will need:\n Hugo installed on your machine: see this guide; ( Windows users: I highly recommend installing Chocolatey and installing Hugo from command line.) git installed on your machine (see this guide); a GitHub account. Markdown knowledge (see this guide on writing content in the context of Academic \u0026amp; Hugo).  Initialize and first deploy (Based on Academic theme documentation: Install with Git)\nThe Academic theme is hosted in a GitHub repository, but we don\u0026rsquo;t want to build the website from scratch.\nIn order to initialize the website with some things already done for us, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the Academic kickstart website. You need to fork the repository into a repository in your own account. Then, the Academic theme is only linked to the kickstart site we are cloning and we need to keep the dependencies alive.\nNow that your GitHub account contains the Academic kickstart clone, clone that repository on your local machine:\ngit clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;your-github-account\u0026gt;/academic-kickstart.git DemoWebsite cd DemoWebsite  As mentioned, your GitHub repository only contains the link to the Academic theme, so you need to clone recursively:\ngit submodule update --init --recursive  Now, your DemoWebsite folder contains all the neccessary to deploy the Academic kickstart website locally. First, we produce the html files from the Markdown source: in the DemoWebsite folder, run\nhugo  At this point, Hugo should have produced the html files in a new public subdirectory. Then, in order to view yhte new content as a proper website, you will need to serve the website locally. Fortunately, Hugo has a built-in feature to do that: simply run\nhugo server  The output should contain a line like\nWeb Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)  which means that your new website is now accessible at the local address http://localhost:1313/.\nSomething interesting about hugo server is that it will rebuild your website anytime you make a change to the DemoWebsite directory. That is, it runs a FastRender version of the hugo command. So, if you make changes to a file, then you can see its effect directly (most web browser have some sort of auto-refresh so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to refresh the page yourselves!) Note that deeper changes (e.g. new pages) won\u0026rsquo;t appear in that FastRender mode so you will need to exit the server (Ctrl+C) and restart it (alternatively, you can deactivate the FastRender mode using hugo server --disableFastRender).\nContent and first edits Now that we have successfully deployed the Academic kickstart site, it is time to take a look at the specifics of it. Your DemoWebsite directory should now contain numerous files and folders. The one of interest to us is the content folder which, as the name indicates, contains all the content of the website.\ncontent ├── authors ├── home ├── post ├── publication └── talk  Authors The authors subdirectory is used to store the different authors for your website. For now, it should only contains one author named admin. The index.md file contained in the admin folder controls the information about that author. In particular, it controls:\n The profile on the homepage if that author is chosen to appear there; The profile appearing with talks, posts and publications of that author.  To change the information about the admin author, simply go through the index.md file and edit it to your needs. It is well documented so it should be clear what everything does.\nThe folder name, here admin, will be the index used to identify posts, publications and talks to the corresponding author. If you need to add additional authors to your website, simply copy the admin folder and change its content. The photo associated to the author should lie in the same folder and have name avatar.jpg/.png.\nHome The home folder controls what appears on the home page, that is, the first page a user will land on. The way the home page is structures is through page sections as known as widgets. On the home page you will see alternating background; each page section is denoted by these alternating background. Thus each file in the home folder determines one of those page sections.\nTo remove some sections, there are two ways:\n Delete the corresponding .md file; Deactivate the section by setting active = false in the front matter.  Let us delete the following sections to clean the current home page:\n demo hero people slider tags  For more details on what each section does, please refer to Getting Started with the Page Builder.\nOne thing to note is how the section are ordered in the home page. It is done through the weight parameter in the front matter where the lowest weight value will appear first.\nPost, Publications and Talks Each of these folder will eventually the corresponding content. These folders are structured as follows (here we consider post) :\npost ├── _index.md └── MyFirstPost └── index.md  The root _index.md defines a landing page are posts are listed. Each subdirectory then defines one post and contains a index.md which defines the corresponding post.\nTo create new content, use the following command:\nhugo new --kind \u0026lt;post/publication/talk\u0026gt; \u0026lt;folder\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;name-of-content\u0026gt;  For example, to create a new publication with identifier Publication1, type\nhugo new --kind publication publication/Publication1  Create a few posts, publications and talks and restart the server since you have now added new pages to the site (Ctrl+c and hugo server).\nFor more details and additional features, see Managing content.\nCourses, workshops, documentation If you wish to have space for courses, documentation or workshops, the best way to go is to use the docs layout defined by the Academic theme. For example, let us create a course folder in the content folder and place a _index.md file at its root. This file should only contains the following front matter\ntitle: Courses layout: docs  Just like posts, publications and talks, this file will define a page listing all courses contained in the directory. The layout: docs parameter means that this landing page will list pages of type docs only.\nThe Academic theme also implements a --kind docs argument to automatically create new docs files:\nhugo new --kind docs course/FirstCourse  For more details and additional features, see Managing content.\nConfiguration The config folder contains various .toml files which define site-wide information and parameters.\nconfig └── _default ├── config.toml ├── languages.toml ├── menus.toml └── params.toml  All these files are fairly well-documented, so there is no reason to go over them here. One thing I would like to point out is the menus.toml file. The navigation bar presently links only toward page sections of the home page. If you would like them to point toward, say, post/_index.md instead of the post section, change the menu entry related to posts :\n[[main]] name = \u0026quot;Posts\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;post\u0026quot; # was \u0026quot;#posts\u0026quot; before weight = 20  Rest of repository The rest of the DemoWebsite repository mostly contains file used to generate the website. You should most likely not have to touch them except:\n data: if you want custom color theme and fonts, you will place them here; static: you can place site-wide files here, such as a custom site icon.  Alternative workflows Using an IDE (e.g., RStudio), everything can be done using the interface with limited command line usage:\n Fork the academic-kickstart repo as above; New Project \u0026gt; Version Control \u0026gt; Git \u0026gt; URL to your GitHub repo \u0026gt; Open in New Session; still need to run git submodule update --init --recursive in the built-in terminal; git action can be done with the Git Tab; hugo command need to be run in the terminal; Look for the R package blogdown to do everything in R console:  Install with RStudio blogdown:::serve_site() acts as hugo server;   ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570494397,"objectID":"89516ada01f13f68e674ffd1d35d9467","permalink":"https://UMichStatistics.github.io/ComputingClub/workshops/hugo_academic/initialize/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/ComputingClub/workshops/hugo_academic/initialize/","section":"workshops","summary":"This part of the workshop is about creating your website using the Hugo engine and the Academic theme.

See Creating content for details on how to do so. Push your content\u0026mdash;You then need to add your content to the website content directory. If you have access to the UMichStatistics repository, then you can do it directly using your favorite \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; workflow. Otherwise, contact the maintainers for them to add your content to the site. Deploy your content\u0026mdash;As mentionned, an update of the files outside the docs folder will not affect the public website. The deployment must be done through Hugo and, for now, this must be done manually. Contact the maintainers for it to happen.  The good way Hopefully, you will want to deploy your changes yourself. To do this, here is the summary of the procedure:\n Have a local copy of the website on your machine. Update your local version. Deploy your local version to your localhost using Hugo in order to update the docs contents. Push your changes, including both the source and the updated docs to the site\u0026rsquo;s repository.  With the workflow, your changes will instantaneously update the public website. Also, since you first deploy on your local machine, you are able to see the results of your changes before them becoming public. Finally, pushing both the source and the updated docs prevents conflicts in future updates.\nRequirements To use this process, you will need:\n Access to the organization repository; git installed on your machine (see this guide); Basic git knowledge (clone, pull, add, commit and push). Note that most modern IDEs offer git support so you may execute all those steps using your interface; Hugo installed on your machine (see this guide. The installation on Windows is tedious and the only way I could make it work was R \u0026gt; install package blogdown \u0026gt; blogdown::install_hugo() and manually add its path to the system environment variables.)  Update the local version First, you will need the latest version of the website stored locally on your machine.\nIf you have not cloned the repository yet, do so:\ngit clone https://github.com/UMichStatistics/ComputingClub.git \u0026lt;new-folder-name\u0026gt;  The website relies on the Academic theme for Hugo, so you will to clone that as well. Fortunately, it is included as a submodule of the repository, so you only need to update all submodules (there is only one):\ngit submodule update [--init] [--recursive]  If you already have cloned the repository, make sure your local version is up to date with the current online version to avoid merge conflicts when pushing. In a command prompt, move to the site local folder and pull the website (or fetch and merge).\nCreate your content Create your specific content by producing the necessary Markdown files and place them in the correct folders. See Creating content for details on how to do so.\nDeploy your local website Now that your local repository contains updated content, it is time to deploy it to your local docs folder. To do so, open a command prompt and run hugo at the root of the site\u0026rsquo;s local repository and type in:\nhugo  which will compile the content into the static html pages. Unless your code does not compile, you should get an output such as (possibly containing warnings)\nBuilding sites … WARN 2019/09/24 17:08:23 In the next Hugo version (0.58.0) we will change how $home.Pages behaves. If you want to list all regular pages, replace .Pages or .Data.Pages with .Site.RegularPages in your home page template. | EN +------------------|----+ Pages | 52 Paginator pages | 0 Non-page files | 6 Static files | 8 Processed images | 9 Aliases | 7 Sitemaps | 1 Cleaned | 0 Total in 265 ms  This means that Hugo has successfuly deployed your site to the docs folder. If you wish to view the website, you can host it locally using Hugo:\nhugo server  which should yield something like\nWatching for changes in /home/simon/git/ComputingClub/{content,data,static,themes} Watching for config changes in /home/simon/git/ComputingClub/config.toml, /home/simon/git/ComputingClub/config/_default Environment: \u0026quot;development\u0026quot; Serving pages from memory Running in Fast Render Mode.

Also, as long a you do not close the server (by closing the command prompt or by typing Ctrl+C), Hugo will listen to any changes, meaning that any file saved in the root repository will trigger deployment. This is useful if you want to create your content and see it deployed instantaneously locally without calling Hugo each time. Note that creating new pages or making large changes may not appear in this \u0026ldquo;Fast Render Mode\u0026rdquo;, so you may need to exit and re-host.\nPush your changes Once your are satisfied with your local version, you need to push your changes to the master branch.

SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) can only copy files to and from a remote server. It is sufficient to push your website, but you cannot remove files using that protocol. This line basically copies everything from \u0026lt;path-to-local-website\u0026gt;/public/ (recursively with the -r option) to your personal space uniqname@login.itd.umich.edu:Public/html/ which is where websites are hosted.\nSFTP and SFTP With a GUI sftp (Secure File Transfer Protocol) offer an interactive session and is therefore more flexible than SCP (see thig guide).\nOpen a terminal in the public folder of your website (or the one where Hugo produces the html files). Connection to the remote server is done via\nsftp uniqname@sftp.itd.umich.edu  You should be prompted to enter your password. You can navigate your personal space usin ls and cd as usual. Move to Public/html and push all the files of public:\nsftp\u0026gt; cd Public/html/ sftp\u0026gt; put -r *  The same can be done using a FTP client GUI (e.g. WinSCP or FileZilla).

The standard library provides asynchronous I/O, process control, logging, profiling, a package manager, and more.\n**Easy to use.**\nJulia has high level syntax, making it an accessible language for programmers from any background or experience level.\n**Open source.**\nJulia is free for everyone to use, and all source code is publicly viewable on GitHub.
