The documentation they provide is quite extensive, so we summarize some of the important features relevant to the current website and present workflow ideas on how to update the website.\nHugo and Markdown While the website consists of html source interpreted by the visitor\u0026rsquo;s browser, its content is generated from Markdown. Hugo acts as an interpreter and compiler: it translates the file structure, the Markdown files and some configuration files (yaml or toml) into the html files visible to the visitor.\nRepository description The website is hosted on GitHub Pages. The static contents of the website appears in the docs folder of the UmichStatistics GitHub organization repository computingclub. The other folders and files of the repository are used to generate the website: only the docs folder is necessary for the static website to be operational.\nDeployment Any change in the files outside of the docs folder will not affect the public website. In order for the changes to become public, it is necessary to deploy the website, i.e. to use Hugo to update the files in docs. Hence, anyone updating the website needs to run Hugo for the changes to appear.

See Creating content for details on how to do so. Push your content\u0026mdash;You then need to add your content to the website content directory. If you have access to the UMichStatistics repository, then you can do it directly using your favorite \u0026lsquo;git\u0026rsquo; workflow. Otherwise, contact the maintainers for them to add your content to the site. Deploy your content\u0026mdash;As mentionned, an update of the files outside the docs folder will not affect the public website. The deployment must be done through Hugo and, for now, this must be done manually. Contact the maintainers for it to happen.  The good way Hopefully, you will want to deploy your changes yourself. To do this, here is the summary of the procedure:\n Have a local copy of the website on your machine. Update your local version. Deploy your local version to your localhost using Hugo in order to update the docs contents. Push your changes, including both the source and the updated docs to the site\u0026rsquo;s repository.  With the workflow, your changes will instantaneously update the public website. Also, since you first deploy on your local machine, you are able to see the results of your changes before them becoming public. Finally, pushing both the source and the updated docs prevents conflicts in future updates.\nRequirements To use this process, you will need:\n Access to the organization repository; git installed on your machine (see this guide); Basic git knowledge (clone, pull, commit and push); Hugo installed on your machine (see this guide. The installation on Windows is tedious and the only way I could make it work was R \u0026gt; install pacakge blogdown \u0026gt; blogdown::install_hugo() and manually add its path to the system environment variables.)  Update the local version First, you will need the latest version of the website stored locally on your machine.\nIf you have not cloned the repository yet, do so:\ngit clone https://github.com/UMichStatistics/computingclub.git \u0026lt;new-folder-name\u0026gt;  If you already have cloned the repository, make sure it is up to date. In a command prompt, move to the site local folder\ncd \u0026lt;path-to-folder\u0026gt;  or simply open a command prompt in that folder. Then, pull the website:\ngit pull  Create your content Create your specific content by producing the necessary Markdown files and place them in the correct folders. See Creating content for details on how to do so.\nDeploy your local website Now that your local repository contains updated content, it is time to deploy it to your local docs folder. To do so, open a command prompt and run hugo at the root of the site\u0026rsquo;s local repository:\ncd \u0026lt;path-to-folder-root\u0026gt; hugo  Unless your code does not compile, you should get an output such as (possibly containing warnings)\nBuilding sites â€¦ WARN 2019/09/24 17:08:23 In the next Hugo version (0.58.0) we will change how $home.Pages behaves. If you want to list all regular pages, replace .Pages or .Data.Pages with .Site.RegularPages in your home page template. | EN +------------------+----+ Pages | 52 Paginator pages | 0 Non-page files | 6 Static files | 8 Processed images | 9 Aliases | 7 Sitemaps | 1 Cleaned | 0 Total in 265 ms  This means that Hugo has successfuly deployed your site to the docs folder. If you wish to view the website, you can host it locally using Hugo:\nhugo server -D  which should yield something like\nWatching for changes in /home/simon/git/computingclub/{content,data,static,themes} Watching for config changes in /home/simon/git/computingclub/config.toml, /home/simon/git/computingclub/config/_default Environment: \u0026quot;development\u0026quot; Serving pages from memory Running in Fast Render Mode. For full rebuilds on change: hugo server --disableFastRender Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/computingclub/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) Press Ctrl+C to stop  The url http://localhost:1313/computingclub/ is where you find your local website (use that in your output as it may differ from mine). Also, as long a you do not close the server (by closing the command prompt or by typing Ctrl+C), Hugo will listen to any changes, meaning that any file saved in the root repository will trigger deployment. This is useful if you want to create your content and see it deployed instantaneously locally without calling Hugo each time.\nPush your changes Once your are satisfied with your local version, you need to push your changes to the master branch. First commit your changes:\ngit commit -a -m 'some description of your changes'  and finally push to the online repository\ngit push  The good way simplified using R ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"24c3d9913df929129210ecc33f7ffcce","permalink":"https://UMichStatistics.github.io/computingclub/workshops/edit_site/workflow/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/computingclub/workshops/edit_site/workflow/","section":"workshops","summary":"The lazy way If you only need to add some post/meeting/workshop to the website, here is a simple way to deploy your new content to the website without much hassle.\n Create your content\u0026mdash;The first step is to create your specific content by producing the necessary Markdown files.
