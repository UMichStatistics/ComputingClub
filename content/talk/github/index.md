title: "A Discussion of Advanced GitHub Usage, Including Actions"
event: "Student Seminar"
event_url:
location: "Remote"
summary: ""
abstract: "This week's seminar is hosted by the UM Statistics Computing Club. Join for an informal discussion of GitHub and some its more advanced features, including how one can use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate various workflows (e.g., building hugo-powered websites from source, running unit tests on pull requests, etc). Some members will briefly demonstrate how they use actions and other features of GitHub.
 
This event will be structured primarily as a discussion with brief ad-hoc demos. Anyone from a beginner to expert is welcome, but we expect that those in attendance will participate, ask questions, and share their knowledge.
