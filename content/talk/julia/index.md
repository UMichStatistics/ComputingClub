abstract: "''Julia in a Nutshell---**Julia is fast!**

Julia was designed from the beginning for high performance. Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms via LLVM.

**Dynamic.**

Julia is dynamically-typed, feels like a scripting language, and has good support for interactive use.

**Optionally typed.**

Julia has a rich language of descriptive datatypes, and type declarations can be used to clarify and solidify programs.

**General.**

Julia uses multiple dispatch as a paradigm, making it easy to express many object-oriented and functional programming patterns. The standard library provides asynchronous I/O, process control, logging, profiling, a package manager, and more.

**Easy to use.**

Julia has high level syntax, making it an accessible language for programmers from any background or experience level.

**Open source.**

Julia is free for everyone to use, and all source code is publicly viewable on GitHub.
