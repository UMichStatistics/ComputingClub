## Package and application manager ([Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))

- Installation: follow the instructions on the [website](https://brew.sh/)
- Basic commands:
  - `brew install <package>` to install a particular package;
  - `brew cask install <application>` to install an application (will appear in the `Applications` folder);
  - `brew search <name>` to list available formulae containing `name`;
- Useful to export some (all) packages to another environment (`brew bundle` command) resolving all dependencies.
