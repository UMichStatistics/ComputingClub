# About me 

I’m an applied statistician working on problems in astronomy and genomics. Graphical models, variational inference, and deep learning are some of the statistical tools I use.

Previously, I was a statistics PhD student at UC Berkeley and a postdoc in Michael Jordan’s research group. For more about me, please see my [publications](https://regier.stat.lsa.umich.edu/publications) and my [CV](https://regier.stat.lsa.umich.edu/assets/pdf/jcr-cv.pdf).
