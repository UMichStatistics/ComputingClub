The Computing Club is proud to announce its expansion to the Biostatistcs department! The Club will now hold joint meetings with PhD students from both the Statistics & Biostatistics department. With this change, we hope to draw even more students to share their computing knowledge. We would like to use this opportunity to welcome [Ben Brennan](https://benbren.github.io/cv/), who will join the organizing committee!

The Club meetings will start back with the 2023 Winter semester. Until then, we invite you to join the [Mcommunity](https://mcommunity.umich.edu/#group:Computing%20Club) which will automatically add you the our new **Slack workspace**. This new workspace is primarily a platform for students to ask for computing help and share things with each other.

We will soon send an **invitation to present** to gather a list of potential presenters and topics!
