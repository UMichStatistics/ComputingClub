# Computing Club website

## Editing the club's website

There is a longer guide available [here](https://umichstatistics.github.io/ComputingClub/workshops/edit_site/) and additional info about producing content is also avaiable [here](https://umichstatistics.github.io/ComputingClub/workshops/hugo_academic/).

Make sure you have the latest **extended** version of hugo; otherwise you will most likely run into some errors.
